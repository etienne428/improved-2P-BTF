# improved-2P-BTF
In this project, we analyze the 2P-BFT-Log protocol and look for threat models, then implement a protocol that couples git's replication protocol and 2P-BFT-Log's validation protocol. Finally, we analyze and when possible measure the security features and the performance of the implementation and compare it with existing implementations.
